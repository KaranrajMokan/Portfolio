                    I'm very passionate about the backend technologies and I find myself deeply 
                    interested in efficient means of data storage and retrieval.
                    I'm also curious about the correlation between various types of frontend
                    and backend. I have always wanted to work with NoSQL databases
                    and thus used Google Firebase's Cloud Firestore (document based) for 
                    an andriod application and Neo4j (graph based) for a restaurant recommendation system.
